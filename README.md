# Jenkins X 3.x GitOps Repository for Azure, Terraform and Vault

This git repository setups the cloud resources required to run Jenkins X on Azure via Terraform and then sets up Jenkins X with Vault.

## Prerequisites

We assume you have access to an Azure tenant and subscription and have logged in to an appropriate subscription via

```sh
az login
az account set -s <subscription_id>
```

Configure the terraform (non secret) variables in `local.tf` based on the table below. You will also need to supply the appropriate secrets
on the command line when running the script below (do not commit these to source files)

| Variable Name | Secret? | Description |
|------|-----|--------|
| `jx_git_url` | `false` | URL for the Jenkins X cluster git repository
| `jx_bot_username` | `false` | Bot username used to interact with the Jenkins X cluster git repository
| `jx_bot_token` | `true` | Bot token used to interact with the Jenkins X cluster git repository

To generate a token for the bot, you can use this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,read:org,user:email,write:repo_hook,delete_repo,admin:repo_hook

This bot user needs to have write permission to write to any git repository used by Jenkins X. This can be done by adding the bot user to the git organisation level or individual repositories as a collaborator Add the new bot user to your Git Organisation, for now give it "Owner" permissions, we will reduce this to member permissions soon.

## Creating/upgrading cloud resources

Run the `./bin/apply.sh` script to generate the terraform resources and modify the `jx-requirements.yml` file.

Now git commit and push any changes...

```bash 
git add *
git commit -a -m "chore: regenerated terraform"
git push
```
